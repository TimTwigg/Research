# RunCommands

This module is reponsible for running a list of MC commands.

- `refocus.py` is a Python module which focuses a running window.
- `runCommands.cpp` is a C++ module which runs the commands. It requires a command-line argument
for the path to the file containing the commands.

The executable is included in the git repository, but may need to be recompiled on the local system.
